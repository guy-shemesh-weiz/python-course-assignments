# Master Mind!
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players invented in Israel.
It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century.


### Rules
The rules are simple! 
The program generates a secret code, and the codebreaker tries to guess it with as few attempts as possible. 
For every guess, the codemaker provides feedback in the form of * and + signs: 
    - A * indicates a correct digit in the **correct** position.
    - A + indicates a correct digit in the **wrong** position.
