## AI Tools usage

I decided to use AI entirely for this project. While searching for ideas, I chose to create a measurement converter. I initially started the project using ChatGPT-5 on the website, but it was very inconvenient, so I decided to switch to Copilot. With Copilot, I used the GPT-5 Mini model in Visual Studio Code, which worked much better.

> I Used ChatGPT-5 in order to write the code here are the prompts I used:

1. "please create me a python converter that can convert volume units, convert mass units, and concetration units"
2. "please create a GUI for the converter using tkinter in seperate file"
3. "now please create for me a cli tool that uses this library"
4. "please create for me a intercative tool that ask the user for the inputs"
5. "please add in the cli too help for each of the types, make sure that all the characters can be typed with normal keyboard (english alphabet only)"
   > From this point decided to use copilot with GPT-5 mini
6. wrote error that I got when manually tested the program
7. "please make sure that the codebase is written with high standard"
8. "please add more tests"
